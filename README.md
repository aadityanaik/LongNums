# LongNums
A custom made proof-of-concept class for handling numbers with large number of digits
<p>
Supports only integers of extreme lengths (max length yet to be determined).
<br/>
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (integer division) and modulus, as well as comparisons with other LongNums or 'int's.
<br/>
<p>
  <h1>Addition:</h1><br/>
  One can simply add two objects of Longnums type or a Longnum objet with an integer using the + symbol-<br/>
  ans = x + y;<br/>
  "x" must be a Longnum. "y" can be either a Longnum or an int.<br/>
  The result must be a Longnum.  
<p>
  <h1>Subtraction:</h1><br/>
  To subtract two objects of Longnums type from one another or an integer from a Longnum object, use the - symbol-<br/>
  ans = x - y;<br/>
  "x" must be a Longnum. "y" can be either a Longnum or an int.<br/>
  The result must be a Longnum.
<p>
  <h1>Multiplication:</h1><br/>
  The multiplication of two objects of Longnums type or a Longnum object with an integer can be achieved using the * symbol-<br/>
  ans = x * y;<br/>
  "x" must be a Longnum. "y" can be either a Longnum or an int.<br/>
  The result must be a Longnum.
<p>
  <h1>Division:</h1><br/>
  Dividing two objects of Longnums type with one another or a Longnum object by an integer can be done using the / symbol-<br/>
  ans = x / y;<br/>
  "x" must be a Longnum. "y" can be either a Longnum or an int.<br/>
  The result must be a Longnum.
<p>
  <h1>Modulo:</h1><br/>
  To find the modulus of an object of Longnums type with another or an integer, use the % symbol-<br/>
  ans = x % y;<br/>
  "x" must be a Longnum. "y" can be either a Longnum or an int.<br/>
  The result must be a Longnum.
